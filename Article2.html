         <h2>Tokyo 2020 Olympics Canceled due to Covid-19</h2>
    
    <h3>The Tokyo 2020 Olympics have been cancelled, and rescheduled for next year</h3>
            
    <section class="ArticleBody">
        
        <p>
        It has been confirmed that the Tokyo 2020 Oplympic Games will be rescheduled to the 23rd July 2021. This comes following a conference call between the International Olympics committee president Thomas Bach and the international sports federations, where the decision to postpone the event was unanimously decided by all parties attending. This decision was made due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, and the games are confirmed to be rescheduled to take place exactly one year after the original planned date, in order to give enough time for the virus to subside before continuing with the event. This also allows any disruptions for other sporting events to be kept to a minimum.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Anyone who has previously purchased tickets for the event will be happy to know that their purchased tickets will remain valid for the rescheduled date in 2021, However should they wish, a full refund of their tickets will be available should they no longer be able to attend due to the changes.
